        "# Predicting DFT Energies with GNNs\n",
        "\n",
        "QM9 is a dataset of 134,000 molecules consisting of 9 heavy atoms drawn from the elements C, H, O, N, F{cite}`ramakrishnan2014quantum`. The features are the xyz coordinates ($\\mathbf{X}$) and elements ($\\vec{e}$) of the molecule. The coordinates are determined from B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level DFT geometry optimization. There are multiple labels (see table below), but we'll be interested specifically in the energy of formation (Enthalpy at 298.15 K). The goal in this chapter is to regress a graph neural network to predict the energy of formation given the coordinates of a molecule. We will build upon ideas in the following chapters:\n",

        "QM9 is one of the most popular dataset for machine learning and deep learning since it came out in 2014. The first papers could achieve about 10 kcal/mol on this regression problem and now are down to ~1 kcal/mol and lower. Any model on this dataset must be translation, rotation, and permutation invariant."
